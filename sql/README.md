# SQL-folder

This folder includes the SQL-files to be driven on first run of the docker-container.

To clarify, these scripts are only run on first run of the postgres docker-container.

If you want to start your postgres from a clean slate, you can clean the postgres by running `rm -rf postgres-data` in the root directory of the backend.
